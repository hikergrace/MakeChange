## Make Change Project

### Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework Make Change

#### Project Description
This cash register project (MakeChangeApp) asks the user for 1) how much an item costs, 2) how much money they are giving me.
The app will then return the amount of change needed in bills and coins. If the customer pays an exact amount, 
The app will return a "thank you" statement. 
If the customer owes more money, the app will let them know how much. 

#### How to Run This Project
Click run.
Type in the amount the item costs, using two decimal places and <strong>no dollar sign</strong>, and click ENTER. 
Ex. for an item that is $5.75, type 5.75; for an item that is $5, type in 5.00

#### Lessons Learned
*I could use probably use arrays and write less code
*This helped me understand casting a little better
*Although I've given instructions to the user to not put in a dollar sign, I'm not sure how to account for a user doing that.
